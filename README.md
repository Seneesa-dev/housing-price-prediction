# Housing Price Prediction 🏠

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques.
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- Housing.csv
- Features include area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, furnishing status, etc.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## ML Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature encoding
3. Train-test split
4. Linear Regression model
5. Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score

## Results
The model achieves a reasonable RMSE and R² score, suitable for a junior ML project.
